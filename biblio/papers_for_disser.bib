It has been shown that the oxidation of the h-BN monolayer occurs through a gradual substitution of N by O in the h-BN lattice. This process leads to the formation of defect sites corresponding to three different types of the B atom environment (BN3-xOx with x=1,2,3). The oxidation of the h-BN monolayer is very different from the case of graphene on Ir(111), where adsorption of atomic oxygen results mainly in the formation of epoxy groups [J. Phys. Chem. C. 115, 9568 (2011)]. A post-annealing of the h-BN monolayer after oxygen exposure results in further destruction of the B N bonds and formation of a B2O3-like structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that oxygen can intercalate h-BN on Co(0001) and also be embedded into its lattice, replacing the nitrogen atoms. Upon substitution, the structures containing one (BN2O) and three (BO3) oxygen atoms in the boron atom environment are formed predominantly. In the case of gold-intercalated h-BN, only the (BN2O) structures are formed; the long-lasting oxygen exposures lead to etching of the h-BN layer.},

The fundamental properties of these high-quality films are discussed on the basis of the data on dispersion relations of valence electrons, phonon dispersion etc. The interfacial orbital mixing of the -state of the monolayer graphite (MG) with the d states of the reactive substrates is the origin for the phonon softening, expansion of the nearest-neighbour C - C distance, modification of the -band, low work function, and two-dimensional plasmons with high electron density, etc. In the cases of weak mixing at the interface between the MG and relatively inert substrates, the observed properties of the MG are very close to the bulk ones. In contrast to the case for MG, the interfacial interaction between the h-BN monolayer and the substrate is weak.},

A significant density of both occupied and unoccupied gap states with N 2p and B 2p characters is observed for h-BN/Ni(111), somewhat less for h-BN/Rh(111) and still less for h-BN/Pt(111). X-ray emission shows that the h-BN monolayer is chemisorbed strongly on Ni(111) and very weakly on Pt(111). We associate the gap states of h-BN adsorbed on the transition metal surfaces with the orbital mixing and electron sharing at the interface because their density increases with the growing strength of chemisorption.},

A negative electron affinity was observed for undoped c-BN films; this phenomenon disappeared upon silicon doping due to the transformation to h-BN.

electronic structures and magnetic properties of a BN sheet functionalized by
an oxygen (O) atom. The adsorption process is typically exothermic, and some
unusual properties can be revealed with different adsorption sites. The energy
gap of the BN sheet narrows due to the strong hybridization between O and BN
electronic states when the O locates above a BN bond or a nitrogen atom. Upon
the adsorption of O above a B3N3 ring or a boron atom, the electrons of the
O-adsorbed BN system are polarized, which gives rise to a magnetic moment of 2.0
μB. In this case, the Fermi level crosses the valence band, resulting in the O-adsorbed BN
system being metallic. Furthermore, potential energy curve analysis shows that the
magnetism and metallicity of the BN system can be modulated by the external
temperature and pressure.},

  abstract  = {Theoretical and experimental studies of the B K-shell absorption near the -excitation in hexagonal boron nitride were carried out. The absorption spectrum over the interval 191.5-193.5 eV was analysed in the framework of the quasi-atomic model with respect to its molecular simulation and for the features of its recombination. Our analysis points to the appearance of local deformations in the crystal lattice around a core-excited atom which are mainly created by the breaking of the ground-state symmetry due to out-of-plane displacements of core-excited boron atoms in a basal plane (0.16 Å). The comparison with the experimental B K-shell absorption spectra for the metastable incoherent phase BN and defect-containing BN crystals supports this polaron mechanism. Methods for the description of the x-ray absorption in solids taking into account the related atomic rearrangement are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Electronic transport in single or a few layers of graphene is the subject of intense interest at present. The specific band structure of graphene, with its unique valley structure and Dirac neutrality point separating hole states from electron states, has led to the observation of new electronic transport phenomena such as anomalously quantized Hall effects, absence of weak localization and the existence of a minimum conductivity(1). In addition to dissipative transport, supercurrent transport has also been observed(2). Graphene might also be a promising material for spintronics and related applications, such as the realization of spin qubits, owing to the low intrinsic spin orbit interaction, as well as the low hyperfine interaction of the electron spins with the carbon nuclei(3,4). Here we report the observation of spin transport, as well as Larmor spin precession, over micrometre-scale distances in single graphene layers. The 'non-local' spin valve geometry was used in these experiments, employing four-terminal contact geometries with ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes making contact with the graphene sheet through a thin oxide layer. We observe clear bipolar (changing from positive to negative sign) spin signals that reflect the magnetization direction of all four electrodes, indicating that spin coherence extends underneath all of the contacts. No significant changes in the spin signals occur between 4.2 K, 77K and room temperature. We extract a spin relaxation length between 1.5 and 2 mm at room temperature, only weakly dependent on charge density. The spin polarization of the ferromagnetic contacts is calculated from the measurements to be around ten per cent.},

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications. {\circledC}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

The spin-relaxation time τs scales inversely with the mobility μ of BLG samples both at room temperature (RT) and at low temperature (LT). This indicates the importance of D'yakonov-Perel' spin scattering in BLG. Spin-relaxation times of up to 2ns at RT are observed in samples with the lowest mobility. These times are an order of magnitude longer than any values previously reported for single-layer graphene (SLG). We discuss the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could lead to the dominance of D'yakonov-Perel' spin scattering in BLG. In comparison to SLG, significant changes in the carrier density dependence of τs are observed as a function of temperature. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, and the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.},

Using chemical vapor deposition, graphene has been successfully synthesized on the insulating, quasifreestanding h-BN monolayer.

  abstract  = {Using a combination of complementary in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we study the fundamental mechanisms underlying the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on polycrystalline Cu. The nucleation and growth of h-BN layers is found to occur isothermally, i.e., at constant elevated temperature, on the Cu surface during exposure to borazine. A Cu lattice expansion during borazine exposure and B precipitation from Cu upon cooling highlight that B is incorporated into the Cu bulk, i.e., that growth is not just surface-mediated. On this basis we suggest that B is taken up in the Cu catalyst while N is not (by relative amounts), indicating element-specific feeding mechanisms including the bulk of the catalyst. We further show that oxygen intercalation readily occurs under as-grown h-BN during ambient air exposure, as is common in further processing, and that this negatively affects the stability of h-BN on the catalyst. For extended air exposure Cu oxidation is observed, and upon re-heating in vacuum an oxygen-mediated disintegration of the h-BN film via volatile boron oxides occurs. Importantly, this disintegration is catalyst mediated, i.e., occurs at the catalyst/h-BN interface and depends on the level of oxygen fed to this interface. In turn, however, deliberate feeding of oxygen during h-BN deposition can positively affect control over film morphology. We discuss the implications of these observations in the context of corrosion protection and relate them to challenges in process integration and heterostructure CVD.},

A large band gap, along with its atomically flat nature without dangling bonds or interface trap states, makes it an ideal candidate for tunnel spin transport in spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate the tunneling of spin-polarized electrons through large area monolayer h-BN prepared by chemical vapor deposition in magnetic tunnel junctions. In ferromagnet/h-BN/ferromagnet heterostructures fabricated on a chip scale, we show tunnel magnetoresistance at room temperature. Measurements at different bias voltages and on multiple devices with different ferromagnetic electrodes establish the spin polarized tunneling using h-BN barriers. These results open the way for integration of 2D monolayer insulating barriers in active spintronic devices and circuits operating at ambient temperature, and for further exploration of their properties and prospects.},

Graphene CVD growth is in stark contrast to the standard growth process of two-dimensional films because it is self-limiting and stops as soon as a monolayer of graphene has been synthesized. Most importantly, a novel phase of metastable graphene was discovered that is characterized by permanent and simultaneous construction and deconstruction. The high quality and large area graphene flakes are characterized by angle-resolved photoemission, proving that they are indeed monolayer and cover the whole 1×1 cm Ni(111) substrate. These findings are of high relevance to the intensive search for reliable synthesis methods for large graphene flakes of controlled layer number.},

Upon mild oxidation in O2 or NO2 at temperatures of 400–450 °C{,} h-BN is transformed to boron oxide (BOx) overlayers{,} which can be converted back to h-BN by heating in NH3 at 800 °C.},

There, the system segregates two alternating phases with different step lattice constants

orientation, we have studied, as a function of the miscut angle, the evolution
of Au(111) faceted structures by scanning tunneling microscopy, and their
electronic surface states by angle-resolved photoemission. We observe that
surface bands reflect the two-phase character of the faceted system, i.e. we find
dw- and
dn-like states that evolve accordingly to the faceted structure. Using a photoemission
calculation we prove that the apparently complex topology hides relatively simple
physics, i.e. the same free-electron-like dispersion and repulsive step scattering that
feature surface bands in stepped noble metal surfaces. On the grounds of such
simulations, we discuss the possible interference of the electronic energy in the
delicate free energy balance that determines the critical size of reconstructed (dw) and
unreconstructed (dn) terraces during Au faceting.},

Curved crystals are excellent platforms to perform such systematics, which may in turn allow to better resolve fundamental properties and reveal new phenomena. This is demonstrated here for the carbon monoxide/platinum system. We curve a platinum crystal around the high-symmetry (111) direction and carry out photoemission scans on top. This renders the spatial core-level imaging of carbon monoxide adsorbed on a 'tunable' vicinal surface, allowing a straightforward visualization of the rich chemisorption phenomenology at steps and terraces. Through such photoemission images we probe a characteristic elastic strain variation at stepped surfaces, and unveil subtle stress-release effects on clean and covered vicinal surfaces. Lastly, these results offer the prospect of applying the curved surface approach to rationally investigate the chemical activity of surfaces under real pressure conditions.},

However, surfaces featuring steps with a large number of low-coordinated kink-atoms have been widely ignored, despite their higher potential for chemistry and catalysis. Here, the equilibrium structure and the electronic states of vicinal Ag(111) surfaces with densely kinked steps are investigated in a systematic way using a curved crystal. With scanning tunneling microscopy we observe an exceptional structural homogeneity of this class of vicinals, reflected in the smooth probability distribution of terrace sizes at all vicinal angles. This allows us to observe, first, a subtle evolution of the terrace-size distribution as a function of the terrace-width that challenges statistical models of step lattices, and second, lattice fluctuations around resonant modes of surface states. As shown in angle resolved photoemission experiments, surface states undergo stronger scattering by fully-kinked step-edges, which triggers the full depletion of the two-dimensional band at surfaces with relatively small vicinal angles.},

Based on the analysis of drastic differences in the spectra from h-BN/Cu(111) and h-BN/Ni(111), it has been concluded that the strength of chemical bonding at the interfaces under study is determined mainly by the strength of the TM 3d-h-BN pi orbital hybridization. On Ni(111) h-BN is found to be strongly chemisorbed, while on Cu(111) only weak chemisorption is observed. On Ni(111) the h-BN monolayer is probably metallic. On Cu(111) the monolayer should possibly also be considered as metallic. however its metallic properties are much less pronounced, and the situation is somewhat uncertain.},

The films are found to be a two-dimensional semimetal with a tiny overlap between valence and conductance bands, and they exhibit a strong ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes in concentrations up to 1013 per square centimeter and with room-temperature mobilities of \~{}10,000 square centimeters per volt-second can be induced by applying gate voltage.},
